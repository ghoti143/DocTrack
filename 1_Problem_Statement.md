# Problem Statement

- **Physician Workflow**: Physicians spend a significant portion of their time rounding in hospitals, often waiting to meet with patients and then catching up on documentation, which leads to inefficiency and physician burnout.
- **Patient Experience**: Families often wait in limbo, unsure of when their provider will arrive. This leads to frustration and missed opportunities for patients and families to take breaks.
