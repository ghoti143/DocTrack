# Go-To-Market Strategy

- **Early Customers**: Begin with hospitals in the Sentara system and leverage existing relationships (i.e., your family’s ties to Sentara and your brother’s position) to secure early adopters.
- **Sales & Marketing**: Utilize direct outreach to hospitals, partnerships, and marketing via healthcare trade shows and conferences. Focus on the value proposition—improved physician workflow, better patient satisfaction, and integration with Epic.
- **Customer Success**: Provide excellent onboarding, training, and support to ensure hospitals get the most value from DocTrack and stay engaged with the product.
